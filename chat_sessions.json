The request body is a JSON object containing the repository owner and name.  The response is the raw markdown content of the README [4].\n\n3.  **`/process_github_repo` (POST):** This endpoint clones a specified GitHub repository, parses relevant files (`.md`, `.py`, `.js`, `.ts`), chunks the content, and embeds it into a ChromaDB collection for RAG. This enables deep RAG-powered conversations using the repository's content [5].  The request body includes the repository URL and a unique identifier for the data in the vector store [5].\n\n\nIn summary, AIRA leverages the GitHub REST API for searching repositories and fetching README files.
